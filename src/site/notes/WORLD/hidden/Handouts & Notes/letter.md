*From Jack*
*To [[Veyk\|Veyk]]*

*Heard you're down on your luck. Been around a situation like yours a time or two myself gambling with someone with that kind of power... No easy feat. If you want to keep your soul and anything else you have you're gonna need a magically suited deck of cards, and infallible lucky charm, and not to mention a wager grand enough to entice a being that already has everything it could ever ask for. I know you got this.*

*May luck be with you.*

*Jack 'of All Trade' D'ante*
