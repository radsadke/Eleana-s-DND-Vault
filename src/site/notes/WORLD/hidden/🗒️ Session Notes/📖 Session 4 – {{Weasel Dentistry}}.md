### Foyer
- Eleana and Beau fail an insight check and are shaken by the picture of us with no teeth.
- Beau is so terrified and recalls that he's felt this feeling before. He is cursed.
	- "Group shared panic"
- Out of the walls the group hears squeaking and crawling out is a pile of weasels.
	- "It's a rat king of weasels, hate that!!"
- The group destroy the pack of weasels.
	- "That's a crispy weasel."

O: "Why are there weasels in the walls?"
E: "Guys, what the fuck was that?"
B: "Beats the hell outta me, I don't-- Ugh, thank you Zora, you were quick to react."
Z: "I got your back Master Beau."
J:  "Hospitality is a good disguise for a trap."
B: "I will chew my words."
O: "Yeah, I think all politeness is over now, right?"
E: "Yeah, we're killing everything in this house."
O: "Ok cool, glad we're on the same page."

- Jiwho explains to the group that he can "call another companion that won't turn on us. If it does, someone take it down."
	- people step back and prepare to attack
	- He summons a direwolf
- The group decide to clear the house
	- J: "Come on puppy, let's go."
- The Crooked man appears again with a flash of lightning and then disappears.

### Music Room
Scattered array of decaying instruments that surrounds a wooden dance floor. The floors are blackened and splintered boards and on the wall hangs a large cracked oval mirror. The reflection looks strange. At the far end is a harpsichord that begins to play on its own. As it does, everyone in the room must roll a wisdom saving throw.
- Grimm, Eleana, and Oseira save. They hear scratches in the walls before more weasels come spilling out.

### After this point the audio is so bad from switching to Roll 20 that I can't decipher the rest of the session... This is me trying my best.
___
- The group fight all of the weasels in the music room
- Jiwho talks to his crooked reflection and then a ghost?
- Jiwho takes a yellowed <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">key</mark> from the harpsichord. 

### Kitchen
- Beau, Zora, and Jiwho go left to where the Ouija board is
- Grimm smells food from the kitchen and can't resist it
- Oseira and Eleana are in the hallway between the two.
- The Food starts attacking Grimm by turning into slime and trying to suffocate him.
- The party attempt to help
	- Eleana uses lightning on slime which... split the slime into two. (not so helpful)
	- Jiwho sends his direwolf in to help
- Eventually the monsters in the kitchen die but Grimm is doing very poorly

### Ouija Board Room
- Everyone agrees that they should take a short rest in here but not everyone is on the same page about messing with the spirits so some sit back.

The flames in the room extinguish

O: "It didn't even know where my sister was!!"
Oseira hears her sisters voice in the distance, "Come find me, why aren't you trying to find me?"

### Kitchen
Zora looks for the cup in the kitchen but notices there are no glasses. They go through the door on the other side of the kitchen.
O: "We should just go upstairs."
B: "Hold on, hold on."
E: "I think it would be wiser to clear the floors first, we'll find her."
O: "Ok, I'm goin' crazy."
### Back of the kitchen
They hear a scream coming from inside the oven out there
Grimm rushes towards it and takes 3 points of damage. The door bursts open and flaming souls spill out screaming. Eleana takes 8 points of damage.

The group investigate the rest of the room and spot a conservatory in the back.

### Conservatory
Jiwho sends in his wolf and it see's an old woman sitting there, just staring. The wolf cocks it's head to the side. Beau enters and tries to talk to the woman.
(I can't hear the audio here and I can't remember everything that was said. I think it was something along the line of she feels bad for her children and the party thinks that she killed her own kids but that's not the case or something like that.)
- Sally - Attention
- Arthur - Doctor
Anyways, Zora tries to persuade the woman to give her one of the momentos, the cup? and she hands it over. She also ends up taking the piece of lace around her neck off and her head falls off? (I might be making that up). Zora puts the ribbon in her hair. Cute! <3
Then the party see the crooked man again and freak out. As he vanishes they hear a maniacal laugh.

### Foyer
The group doubles back to the entry way, intending to explore the room on the first floor. Grimm opens the door on the left. Paintings and statues line the wall, the centerpiece being a peacock featuring eyes made of gems.

Osiera hears something from upstairs.
- O: "Guys, she's up there. We have to go!"
Eleana and Jiwho step up to Osiera in an attempt to sway her mind
- E: "Wait a minute, Osiera."
- O: "I can't"
Osiera hears writing and has a burning urge to check her sisters' book. As she flips to the last page she see's an image of her sisters necklace laying atop a bed. Behind the bed attached to the wall are two shackles and chains.
Osiera places one foot on the step. Eleana attempts to block her path but fails. Beau attempts to cast suggestion but fails. 
- "Just wait five minutes, you can't go alone!"
Osiera rushes past her. Eleana runs after her.
Zora sighs
- "We can come back after we find the others I guess."
### Upstairs
The two run down a strange bent hallway framing a creaking door at it's end. They charge inside and stop to see a large bed, the same from the image in Osiera's book. The whole room is terrifying, decrepit, cracked, disheveled. The mirror on the vanity is shattered. Atop the writing desk is a beautiful black leather journal adorned with the initials P.D.

On the bed is her sisters necklace. On the wall is scratched and bloody imagery of someone being chained to the wall with the word "crooked" written over and over. The centerpiece shows a female figure in a pit covered in (centipedes?) and dirt raining down.

### End of Session

O: "What the fuck?"
Z: "No, Osiera doesn't get to say 'What the fuck?'"
B: "You did this to yourself."
