### Foyer
- Eleana and Beau fail an insight check and are shaken by the picture of us with no teeth.
- Beau is so terrified and recalls that he's felt this feeling before. He is cursed.
	- "Group shared panic"
- Out of the walls the group hears squeaking and crawling out is a pile of weasels.
	- "It's a rat king of weasels, hate that!!"
- The group destroy the pack of weasels.
	- "That's a crispy weasel."

O: "Why are there weasels in the walls?"
E: "Guys, what the fuck was that?"
B: "Beats the hell outta me, I don't-- Ugh, thank you Zora, you were quick to react."
Z: "I got your back Master Beau."
J:  "Hospitality is a good disguise for a trap."
B: "I will chew my words."
O: "Yeah, I think all politeness is over now, right?"
E: "Yeah, we're killing everything in this house."
O: "Ok cool, glad we're on the same page."

- Jiwho explains to the group that he can "call another companion that won't turn on us. If it does, someone take it down."
	- people step back and prepare to attack
	- He summons a direwolf
- The group decide to clear the house
	- J: "Come on puppy, let's go."
- The Crooked man appears again with a flash of lightning and then disappears.

### Music Room
Scattered array of decaying instruments that surrounds a wooden dance floor. The floors are blackened and splintered boards and on the wall hangs a large cracked oval mirror. The reflection looks strange. At the far end is a harpsichord that begins to play on its own. As it does, everyone in the room must roll a wisdom saving throw.
- Grimm, Eleana, and Oseira save. They hear scratches in the walls before more weasels come spilling out.
___
### After this point the audio is so bad from switching to Roll 20 that I can't decipher the rest of the session... This is me trying my best.
___
- The group fight all of the weasels in the music room
- Jiwho talks to his crooked reflection and then a ghost?
- Jiwho takes a yellowed <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">key</mark> from the harpsichord. 

### Kitchen
- Beau, Zora, and Jiwho go left to where the Ouija board is
- Grimm smells food from the kitchen and can't resist it
- Oseira and Eleana are in the hallway between the two.
- The Food starts attacking Grimm by turning into slime and trying to suffocate him.
- The party attempt to help
	- Eleana uses lightning on slime which... split the slime into two. (not so helpful)
	- Jiwho sends his direwolf in to help
- Eventually the monsters in the kitchen die but Grimm is doing very poorly

### Ouija Board Room
- Everyone agrees that they should take a short rest in here but not everyone is on the same page about messing with the spirits so some sit back.
