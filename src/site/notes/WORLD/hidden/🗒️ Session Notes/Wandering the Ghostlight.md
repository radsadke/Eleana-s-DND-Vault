@Staff @Crooked Moon Fridays
2:32 AM
    *As you all wander through the strange construct known as the Ghostlight Express there doesn't seem to be any more immediate danger, giving you all brief moments of conversation amongst your strange new group of acquaintances*
#### <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">radsadke (Eleana) </mark>
Eleana just stares at Brian thinking "How the hell is this going to help me?"
#### <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Jiwho</mark>
 While Jiwho is searching through the bags, he starts calmly asking @radsadke (Eleana) some questions. His words are even and calm. Not unfriendly, but unreadable. (1) "You handled yourself well in the fight, where did you learn to fight like that?", (2) "You didn't seem surprised to fight besides surfacers and others. Have you done it before?", and (3) "When I approached the group, it seems you recognized Eilistraee's symbol. Do you know of her?"
#### <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Podlox (Trick) </mark>
Trick would wander through the room with quiet steps, scanning for anything useful for the road ahead. He would move like someone used to slipping through places unnoticed, fingers absently flicking a worn playing card between them. He would keep to himself, as he is not one to start conversations unless approached. There is a distance to him, watchful calculation, like he is always weighing odds, even in silence.
#### <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Jayden(Ahri/Beau)</mark>
Beauregard approaches trick, grinning as usual. “So, you new to Druskenvalde? Or do you spend your summers out here? Only reason i ask.” He says glancing around the car to the others. “It seems just about everyone here is running towards something or away from something. Which is it for you?”
#### <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Jiwho</mark>
Just putting this out to the group… Jiwho is going to suggest taking a short rest back in the earlier car. If memory serves, this trip is supposed to take days and we are hurting a bit. If we take 4 hrs, I can get a spell slot back as I only have 1 heal and that would be immediately after someone hits 0 so they never drop “split second unconscious, heal, conscious.” If we have another fight, still 1 heal but no buff.
#### <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">radsadke (Eleana) </mark>
@jiwho Eleana seems uncomfortable but replys "I know how to fight when I need to". She eyes him up and down resting on the symbol with a look of confusion but slight recognition. "I don't know of Eilistraee, but I know good from evil."
#### <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Jiwho</mark>
After Eleana’s last statement, Jiwho continues to search through the luggage and remains quiet, letting this quietness stretch a moment longer than comfort would normally allow. Then he says, “Knowing the difference is one thing. Acting on it… that’s harder.” Then moves his gaze over to Beauregard to quietly observe their interaction without getting involved.
#### <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Jayden(Ahri/Beau)</mark>
“Just another colorful crowd then? What about you two? Enjoying the shared silence, Know each other?” He says, glancing between the drow. “Done my fair share of business to know a thing or two about your culture, am i wrong to assume you hail from the underdark?”
#### <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">radsadke (Eleana) </mark>
Eleana lets out a small chuckle and responds "You're not wrong... but we don't know eachother. Seems like we're all riding the same train for now though and should probably work together."
#### <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Podlox (Trick)</mark>
@Jayden(Ahri/Beau) Trick doesn’t look up right away, just gives the card one last spin between his fingers before slipping it back into his sleeve. “Maybe a bit of both,” he says with a half-smile. “Though I’ve found running in circles keeps the knives out of your back longer than standing still.” He glances at Beauregard, “What about you? You the chasing kind… or the hiding kind?”
#### <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Jayden(Ahri/Beau)</mark>
“By all means, i agree. Id rather mingle with you corporeal folk than the poor souls on these tracks.” He leans against the wall. “The big one, Grimm was it? he seems all business and no flair. Tightening my rings around ol’ trick here. And zora.. maybe ill step out of her way when she does that zombie bit.” He glances at trick. “Always the chasing. Definitely not the hunter type though. Matter of fact i dont enjoy a fight, but seems we might see a few.”
#### <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Jiwho</mark>
Jiwho raises an eyebrow slightly and takes a breath before responding. “We know each other as well as two Drow meeting outside the Underdark usually do.” He gives a faint, dry smile — almost amused, but not quite. “And yes, you’d be right. It seems we’re both from below.” Then, with a quiet shrug as he turns back to his searching: “The sun still feels strange, but the company’s improving.”
#### <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">radsadke (Eleana)</mark>
"Our zombie killer looks a little hurt, maybe we should rest for a bit"
#### <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Jayden(Ahri/Beau)</mark>
“We should. Might be a decent idea.” He sat on a trunk. “There is the question if more of the shroud got in elsewhere. Or if it was just tricks meddling that made that one go banshee berserk.”
#### <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Schadrach (Korrin/Zora)</mark>
"Ha, I don't know if you're talking about me or the big fella over here but I'm just gonna sit down for a minute. Maybe see if I can figure out just exactly what that creature did to me, because holy shit my armor hasn't felt this heavy since I was a kid." _Zora tucks her compass away in her backpack, placing it carefully in its pouch_ "Anyways, sorry for spacing out there for a while with the compass. Didn't expect it to, well, start working".
#### <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Jayden(Ahri/Beau)</mark>
“Let me guess, its a compass that dont point north? Does weird stuff?” Beau taps the pouch with his cane. “Im curious what it _does_ point to.”
#### <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Jiwho</mark>
Oh, shit… forgot about your zapped strength. Might need a long rest to try to recover as you were already healed.
#### <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Schadrach (Korrin/Zora)</mark>
Her eyes glaze over for a bit, then she looks back to Beau_ “Y’know it’s weird, I’m having a hard time recalling when it ever worked. I was never tremendous at directions but I figure it had to point north? And I wouldn’t know where north is in this train, but far as I can tell it’s pointing to the front of the train” _she smiles at Beau_ “anyways, that’s a fine collections of rings you’ve got on your, uh, paw, there. And a flashy cane. How’d you come by them?”
#### <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Jayden(Ahri/Beau)</mark>
“Earned gold there. I spent almost a decade working for a thieves guild. Mediated and wrote up contracts for jobs. Cleared up misunderstandin’s. In a short way, I was the last one folks spoke to before blades drew. Nare’do’wells tend to respect a little bit of gold on you.” He grinned. “As for the cane? It was a gift paired with my flask a couple years back. A farewell gift, the flask. But the cane is from my employer.”
#### <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Schadrach (Korrin/Zora)</mark>
_She’ll raise an eyebrow at Beau but not press on that matter of employer and thieves guild, what with how helpful he was in the fight. And she’ll turn to Jiwho_ “I won’t lie a good long rest would be nice! But, if we have to press on I think I’m at least still strong enough to keep my armor on without slowing us down any.” (edited)
#### <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Jayden(Ahri/Beau)</mark>
“You did take a nasty blow, if it makes you feel any better im sure my heart wouldve stopped being hit that hard.” He felt his coat. “I usually carry potions on me, not today it seems.”
#### <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Mike (Grimm/Garrick)</mark> 
Grimm out of nowhere snaps at the group "You all are so calm and casual. I don't know who you all are or where you're from. What I do know is that I was on the brink scientific breakthrough. Something that would the change the course of history. The next moment I'm somewhere completely different, talking of death, and looking like some sort of wolf man hybrid. I want answers and I want them now." (edited)
#### <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Jiwho</mark> 
Jiwho shifts slightly, weight barely perceptible, voice low and even. “I woke up in a world I was never meant to survive… and spent a century trying to find a reason to keep breathing. If you want answers, I hope you find them. But don’t expect them to come fast—or clean.”
#### <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Jayden(Ahri/Beau)</mark>
“Easy my fur covered friend. So youve come to a bit of a change. No need to get all worked up.” He puts a hand on his shoulder. “Panic never got anyone anywhere good. Take a breath and slow down.”
#### <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">radsadke (Eleana)</mark>
Eleana flinches
#### <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Mike (Grimm/Garrick)</mark> 
"I AM NOT IN A PANIC! I have been put in quite an unsatisfactory position against my will. I'd like to better understand the finer details of my current arrangement immediately. I am not one to sit idle and let the gods dictate what happens to me." Grimm pauses realizing how quite angry and aggressive he has become. "I apologize for my tone, for some reason ever since I have awaken to whatever this is, there is something inside of me. Something new and enraged that I am not used to. I will try to keep my wits about me as long as we are in company. Though I can't promise my reaction in situations that require a hands on approach. Earlier in the original passenger car, it seemed as though I became someone... something else when faced with violence." 
#### <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Jayden(Ahri/Beau)</mark>
“Oh ive heard of that somewhere before. Got an unwelcome passenger? Two minds sharing the same eyes?” He chuckles. “I think i know your type. Try and make sense of things there aint no sense to be be made? Look Friend, Heres what i say, take it or leave it. You can make friends with that extra voice in your head for the time being, hopefully you can cooperate. It sounds like none of you folk are familiar with the place. Roll with the punches. And you said your name was grimm?”
#### <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Mike (Grimm/Garrick)</mark> 
“Yes, Grimm Halvrek. I come from Ravnica. Tell me Beau, are you of the same situation as I or have you always been this hybrid creature? I’m not familiar with the proper name as it doesn’t seem to be something I’ve come across in my studies before.” (edited)
### <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Jiwho</mark> 
Joke only - not saying it. Jiwho looks at Grimm and says he has a scroll that can remove that part that is not wanted. Some side effects observed during limited experimental studies. (edited)
#### <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Jayden(Ahri/Beau)</mark>
“What, you aint never seen some ratfolk before? And dont say _Creature_ like its some disease friend. ‘Fraid ive never been to ravnica.” Beau grinned. “Sounds nice enough though.”
####  <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Mike (Grimm/Garrick)</mark>
“Well I’ve made plenty use of rats in my work but I’ve never seen or heard of one standing upright and speaking common. I’ve traveled and am well versed in different fiends, monsters, beasts, fey, and demons but I’ve never quite seen something like us.”
#### <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">radsadke (Eleana)</mark>
(ooc daym)
#### <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Jayden(Ahri/Beau)</mark>
(Actually, how tall is grimm?)
#### <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Mike (Grimm/Garrick)</mark>
6ft, when I hit lvl 3 I get to grow in size when I rage!
#### <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Jayden(Ahri/Beau)</mark>
“Well, i have seen folk like you, but i dont think youll like the term.” He looks him over. “Ive seen a couple of were-beasts in my time. Although you arent as big or vicious. No offense.”
#### <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Mike (Grimm/Garrick)</mark>
“Ah what you’re referring to is called lycanthropy but I can see how a simple fellow as yourself could be confused. Lycanthropy is an affliction that changes someone to a beast and back. Though even that is mere fiction that children get told to fall in line. As you can see, there is no changing back for me… (slaps himself in the face) at least not yet.” (edited) “Oh I’m sorry, that was rude wasn’t it? I merely meant to suggest that such details can typically confuse people who are not as learned as I am.”“Anyways, please tell me more of you and your people. How did you all become, Ratfolk? Was it a curse, magic, or perhaps some sort of selective breeding? Have you ever been to any of the main cities? I bet the universities would pay a fortune to study you. I might even be able to get my position back if you’d let me lead the effort.” 
### <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">radsadke (Eleana) </mark>
Eleana let’s out “gross, hes not some lab rat”
#### <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Mike (Grimm/Garrick)</mark>
“Oh no, you have me all wrong miss. He obviously has a much higher consciousness than the animals used in experiments. I’m merely suggesting taking some tissue samples and perhaps some voluntary tests. He would be greatly compensated. The school in Waterdeep would be perfect.” 
“We mustn’t accept mediocrity when the tools to create perfection are in front of us.” 
“The same goes for you @Podlox (Trick) . Were you always like this? It seems as though you are some mix of a tiefling and a scorpion? Have you always been this way like this fellow here or did you fall to the same unfortunate fate as I?”
“Maybe you give me some blood and some poison for me to study?” 
#### <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Podlox (Trick)</mark> 
Trick raises an eyebrow, expression unreadable. “Can you have my blood and venom? That’s a first.” He lets the question hang a moment, then adds dryly, “I’m not a lab sample, friend. Whatever brought me back… it didn’t come with a user manual.” His tail gives a slow, deliberate sway. “And if there’s something crawling in my veins, I’d rather not know what it is, much less hand it over to a stranger I just met...” He gives a slow blink. “No offense.”
#### <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Mike (Grimm/Garrick)</mark>
Grimm chuckles to himself looks at @Podlox (Trick) with a slight grin and says "Alright for now, but before this is done I'm gonna get me that sample"
