- Lines & Veils discussed
- Welcoming out newest player: Osiera

Recap:
We spent last session freeing ghosts and winding up in the tender only for the tank to explode, Zoras shadow breaking at the neck, and the party being thrust into the woods to fight an angry spectral train.

The party stands there in the aftermath of the battle staring at the train. Trick had just given them his goodbyes and Mr. Druskenvald had just thanked them and given the party tokens of gratitude when Jiwho spots a figure attempting to hide in the woods.

She finds herself at home in the woods, the fog surrounding her home is thicker than usual and carries whispers in the wind. As she goes around doing her normal daily tasks, gardening and making wicker toys for the spirits, she notices the mist doesn't disperse. She sees a light in the distance calling her from inside the fog. 

It's hard to look away from, no matter how unsettling it is. "Dierdra?" she calls for her sister. She waits and no one answers. As she looks around it's strange, it's almost as if her sister had just vanished, leaving her belongings behind. Osiera finds a journal in her sisters room. She runs outside screaming for her sister, looks for tracks... no luck. She wonders if it's in the direction of the light and runs after it. 

Trees and mist surround her as she runs. The trees become tall and overbearing. Above she sees a terrifying moon staring down at her with a crooked nose, crooked teeth, and a crooked gaze. Smiling. This reminds her of when her sister began complaining of terrifying nightmares of a man with a crooked smile and a bent neck. 

Ahead of her she spots five adventurers standing with two well-dressed people. This is when Jiwho spots her. The party sees a very tall elf with unkempt matted grey hair wearing a basic tunic. She has a staff that looks like a big stick with some wicker wrappings around it.

She seems very panicked and is making a poor attempt to go unnoticed by the party.

Z: "We see you."
E: "Are you Alright?"
O: "What the fuck is going on? Where am I?"
B: "You're in Druskenvald."
O: "What do you mean? I was just at home."
(Beau at some point says "Don't worry, I'm native to these parts" like okay??? We're just gonna gloss over that? I see you Beau.)
O: "Have you seen my sister? She looks like me but prettier."
B: "You're the first soul I've seen out here."
Mr: "If you're looking for someone the best bet is hitting up civilization. we're going to Wickermore Hollow, it isn't far."

The party convinces her to tag along, it isn't safe in these woods.

Osiera tells the party how she ended up here.
Mrs:  "oh darling that must have been so terrible. But you're here which means you are here for a reason. As soon as we get back to the estate I'd love to read your cards."
O: "uh sure I guess, that sounds fine... uhm..  ok .. ok yeah if i cant find my si... yeah ok" she says shellshocked.

It's a quaint town. In the distance the party hears a church bell as they arrive at the circular town square. they see a weathered statue of a man in front of an old tree covered in hundreds of carved faces. Suddenly they hear a screech and notice something staked to the ground at the base of the tree. Across the square they see a pack of wolves approach the figure with guttural deep growls and eyes filled with bloodlust.

Staked to the ground seems to be a burlap sack filled with a human shaped figure. Eleana lets off a magic missile towards the wolves before beau could charm them and a battle ensues. All the wolves are killed by the party except for the dire wolf which was charmed to be loyal to Beau for 24 hours.

Mr: "Aren't you going to kill the dire wolf?"
B: "The wolf won't hurt anybody."
The wolf runs away
(In Beaus head): "Some creatures here have already been tamed by another master."
B: "Can't have shit in here."

A door on the square opens and a man appears. Short, portly, middle aged, and wearing a fine 3 piece suit with a bolar hat. 
```
"A thousand apologies, you caught us in the middle of one of our sacred rituals." He gestures to the Druskenvalds, "So pleased you finally accepted the invitation to our humble community. Welcome everyone. I am very sorry for what you've witnessed, that was our yearly ritual we do as a sacrifice to the woodland creatures for the Green Queen."
