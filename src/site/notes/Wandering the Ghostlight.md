@Staff @Crooked Moon Fridays
2:32 AM
    *As you all wander through the strange construct known as the Ghostlight Express there doesn't seem to be any more immediate danger, giving you all brief moments of conversation amongst your strange new group of acquaintances*

Eleana just stares at Brian thinking "How the hell is this going to help me?"

#### <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Jiwho _—_ 7/5/2025 11:02 AM</mark>
 While Jiwho is searching through the bags, he starts calmly asking @radsadke (Eleana) some questions. His words are even and calm. Not unfriendly, but unreadable. (1) "You handled yourself well in the fight, where did you learn to fight like that?", (2) "You didn't seem surprised to fight besides surfacers and others. Have you done it before?", and (3) "When I approached the group, it seems you recognized Eilistraee's symbol. Do you know of her?"

Trick would wander through the room with quiet steps, scanning for anything useful for the road ahead. He would move like someone used to slipping through places unnoticed, fingers absently flicking a worn playing card between them. He would keep to himself, as he is not one to start conversations unless approached. There is a distance to him, watchful calculation, like he is always weighing odds, even in silence.

Beauregard approaches trick, grinning as usual. “So, you new to Druskenvalde? Or do you spend your summers out here? Only reason i ask.” He says glancing around the car to the others. “It seems just about everyone here is running towards something or away from something. Which is it for you?”
#### <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Jiwho _—_ 1:11 PM</mark>
Just putting this out to the group… Jiwho is going to suggest taking a short rest back in the earlier car. If memory serves, this trip is supposed to take days and we are hurting a bit. If we take 4 hrs, I can get a spell slot back as I only have 1 heal and that would be immediately after someone hits 0 so they never drop “split second unconscious, heal, conscious.” If we have another fight, still 1 heal but no buff.
#### <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">radsadke (Eleana) _—_ 1:43 PM</mark>
@jiwho Eleana seems uncomfortable but replys "I know how to fight when I need to". She eyes him up and down resting on the symbol with a look of confusion but slight recognition. "I don't know of Eilistraee, but I know good from evil."
#### <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Jiwho _—_ 2:17 PM</mark>
After Eleana’s last statement, Jiwho continues to search through the luggage and remains quiet, letting this quietness stretch a moment longer than comfort would normally allow. Then he says, “Knowing the difference is one thing. Acting on it… that’s harder.” Then moves his gaze over to Beauregard to quietly observe their interaction without getting involved.
#### <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Jayden(Ahri/Beau)!GAWD _—_ 2:21 PM</mark>
“Just another colorful crowd then? What about you two? Enjoying the shared silence, Know each other?” He says, glancing between the drow. “Done my fair share of business to know a thing or two about your culture, am i wrong to assume you hail from the underdark?”
#### <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">radsadke (Eleana) _—_ 2:26 PM</mark>
Eleana lets out a small chuckle and responds "You're not wrong... but we don't know eachother. Seems like we're all riding the same train for now though and should probably work together."

#### <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Podlox (Trick) _—_ 2:29 PM</mark>
@Jayden(Ahri/Beau) Trick doesn’t look up right away, just gives the card one last spin between his fingers before slipping it back into his sleeve. “Maybe a bit of both,” he says with a half-smile. “Though I’ve found running in circles keeps the knives out of your back longer than standing still.” He glances at Beauregard, “What about you? You the chasing kind… or the hiding kind?”

#### <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Jayden(Ahri/Beau)!GAWD _—_ 2:30 PM</mark>
“By all means, i agree. Id rather mingle with you corporeal folk than the poor souls on these tracks.” He leans against the wall. “The big one, Grimm was it? he seems all business and no flair. Tightening my rings around ol’ trick here. And zora.. maybe ill step out of her way when she does that zombie bit.” He glances at trick. “Always the chasing. Definitely not the hunter type though. Matter of fact i dont enjoy a fight, but seems we might see a few.”

Eleana lets out a small chuckle and responds "You're not wrong... but we don't know eachother. Seems like we're all riding the same train for now though and should probably work together."
#### <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Jiwho _—_ 2:32 PM</mark>
Jiwho raises an eyebrow slightly and takes a breath before responding. “We know each other as well as two Drow meeting outside the Underdark usually do.” He gives a faint, dry smile — almost amused, but not quite. “And yes, you’d be right. It seems we’re both from below.” Then, with a quiet shrug as he turns back to his searching: “The sun still feels strange, but the company’s improving.”
#### <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">radsadke (Eleana) _—_ 2:34 PM</mark>
"Our zombie killer looks a little hurt, maybe we should rest for a bit"
#### <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Jayden(Ahri/Beau)!GAWD _—_ 2:36 PM</mark>
“We should. Might be a decent idea.” He sat on a trunk. “There is the question if more of the shroud got in elsewhere. Or if it was just tricks meddling that made that one go banshee berserk.”
