As Grimm touches the bag, it immediately attunes to him. 
As he looks inside the bag, an arm slips into the darkness.
The bag man is a creature that lives inside of your bag of holding that can potentially cause "*VERY BAAD THIIINGS*" 
If he shakes the bag, Grimm knows that it will attack the closest thing.
Every time he finishes a long rest, Grimm must roll a 1d6.
