# 🚂 Recap
We find ourselves back on [[Definitions/The Ghostlight Express\|The Ghostlight Express]], halfway through the train next to a sleeping tiger surrounded in green flame. Trick pokes the tiger while beau tries to speak to it with no luck. After much back and forth and failed attempts to take its ring the party moves to the next train car.

# 🎪 Circus Car

"The next car is strange... lining the car are five empty cages, decaying hay, musty water, and the smell of iron-blood." There are remnants of a circus, twisted whimsy, faded banners, terrifying animals, sideshows.

Suspended from the center of the car is a spectral woman dressed as a [[Jester\|Jester]], swinging from a trapeze. Her face is racked with shame. The party watches her attempt a flip and unceremoniously land on the floor, muttering to herself.

> "*Mr. Jay would have gotten rid of me after what I did to all those poor people... I wish they didn't get hurt..*."

The party asks her if she's okay, why she is so sad.
> "*To make up for what I did... I did such a bad thing. Dozens of people died. I wish I could make sure it never happened again. I just wanted to pet the pretty kitty...*"

The party asks her about the tiger in the previous room. They ask what the ring is that is on its tail.
> "*I know that ring anywhere, it's an identification ring."

The party asks her why she let the tiger out
> "*Well, i mean... I just thought he was gonna be nice. He was purring and he took off and hurt all of those people."

The party try to console her. 
"*It's not your fault, it's whoever left it in that cage*" 
"*Yeah, tigers aren't meant to be in cages*"

She gives a slight smile, "*I guess you're right*". She floats through the room and disappears with a melancholy expression on her face, not entirely at peace but released from her guilt.

The party investigate the room and old circus games and a box of creepy marionette puppets. Beau discovers one with a rock as its head, painted like a toad.

## 📬 Mail Car

The next car is filled with two rows of heavy mail satchels and bins filled with parcels and envelopes. In the center there is a ghostly man, with a seagull on its head, moving packages back and forth. 
[[The Mariner\|The Mariner]]

"*I just wish I could see the sea on more time... only thing that feels like I'm back where I should be - I should have died on the sea."


Beau uses minor illusion to create a picture of the sea.
> "*I don't know what ye'r trying to show me but all I see is a dirty hand.*"

Eleana Investigates the mail car and discovers:
- Right: 
	- Thoughts, prayers, poems, and offerings to the dead by living family and loved ones.
- Left: 
	- Letters from deported souls to their loved ones still living
	- A pink letter, inscribed with: *To my dear sweetheart, From Jacob Braun*

Grimm asks the mariner to "*Tell me your favorite story of the sea*".
> "*I could go on for hours... stories o' friends and people lost. Happier times. But none of it will ever bring me closer to 'er. I will continue to load the mail like I am on me ship.*"

Suddenly, a [[letter\|letter]] falls, addressed to "[[Veyk\|Veyk]]". On the back it reads "[[Jack 'of All Trades' D'ante\|Jack 'of All Trades' D'ante]]". Jiwho picks it up and it disappears as he tries to pocket it. Five more rain down near Trick. 
> "*Well it seems someone is sending you a message from beyond.*"

Trick tries to pocket the letter unnoticed. 
- Beau insight: 16 (suspicious)
- Trick deception: 26 (stone faced)

Grimm hears the sound of a woman speaking in the next car and the party move on.

## 🥂 The Lounge Car

The next car opens into understated luxury. The walls are lined with gold patterns, there is plush velvet and soft light. Landscape painting line the wall, a painting of the ocean at night catch the eyes of the party.

At the bar is a man, Phillip ([[Definitions/Mr. Druskenvald\|Mr. Druskenvald]]) and his wife Adela ([[Definitions/Mrs. Druskenvald\|Mrs. Druskenvald]]) sits at a table with champagne in her hand. The two laugh as they hear the door open.

Phillip:   *Hello friends, my name is Phillip. I'm the lord here and this is my wife Adela.*
Adela:   *More Living people, this is fantastic! I've seen you guys before in my  dreams or something.*
Eleana:  *You've seen us in your dreams?*  
Adela:   *Indeed. I'm what they call clairvoyant.*  

Mr. Druskenvald invites the group to stay with them in their own [[Chateau Claire de Lune\|Chateau Claire de Lune]], which he claims has over a thousand rooms as the trips aboard [[Definitions/The Ghostlight Express\|The Ghostlight Express]] only happen once every two weeks. 

The party introduce themselves as they meet at the bar. Trick tries to poke Mr.Druskenvald, who takes his cane and lowers Trick's hand. Beau bows to Mr. Druskenvald. Everyone grabs some alcohol ... or milk. Grimm approaches adela and says, "Madam, Grim halverek, science expert of the mortal realm, leading expert. I am pleased to meet your service." Jiwho compliments Adelas cards and she offers everyone a Tarot reading.

### 🎶 The Songstress

[[The Songstress\|The Songstress]]
In the corner is a ghostly woman who stares longingly our the window, cigarette in hand. 

Beau:    "*Seat Taken ma'am?*"
Ghost: "*No*" -takes a big drag of her smoke- "*All yours.*"
Beau: "*Looks like something's eatin' at you.*"
Ghost: "*Just the fact I never found that perfect song.*"

Eleana offers her the Jazz record that she had found in the sleeper car but the ghost replies "*I have nothing to play it on*". The party assure her that they will return with a record player so she can give one final performance.
