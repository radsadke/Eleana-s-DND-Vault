During the walk to town, Jiwho steps to left of @radsadke (Eleana) and keeps a bit of distance from her while still able to hold a quiet conversation (depends on perception, but the left side with slight distance would be one of the most defensible locations for Jiwho). In a quiet and calm tone, Jiwho asks Eleana, “You don’t carry yourself like you serve Lolth. Not openly, anyway. Am I wrong?” Depending on the response, if Jiwho feels comfortable that Eleana is not a follower of Loith (or a known Evil deity), Jiwho would conclude the conversation by saying, “I’m still figuring out who to trust. I don’t expect much—but I notice when someone watches my back. Thank you.” Should Jiwho believe Eleana is a follower of an evil deity, then in a measured tone would say, "Lolth has many children. Not all of them are loyal, some are just... afraid." At that point, Jiwho would slow his step and slowly allow Eleana to walk ahead of him.

Eleana slows to meet his pace, then speaks in a measured but sharp tone. "Lolth doesn't have my loyalty. She took my father and cursed my blood. I owe her nothing but the ruin she gave me." She turns slightly, just enough to meet his eyes in the dark. "so no, you're not wrong. But don't mistake silence for allegiance."

After giving his thanks, Jiwho gives a silent nod, then turns his head back to in front of him and continues to walk silently beside Eleana.
